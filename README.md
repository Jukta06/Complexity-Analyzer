The Complexity Analyzer is a Java-based software tool designed to evaluate the time complexity and space complexity of the codes written in C and Java language. With this application, user can input any piece of code and receive time complexity and space complexity of the code.Simply user can input his code by text or by file name into the applicationâ€™s interface. Once the code is inputted, Complexity Analyzer meticulously examines its time complexity and space complexity. It considers various factors such as loops, recursive calls and data structures used within the code. After analysis, this display the time complexity and space complexity of the given code using Big O notation.The Complexity Analyzer outputs the worst-case time complexity and space complexity.
